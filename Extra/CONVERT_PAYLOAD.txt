make sure that you have nuitka installed

## HOW TO INSTALL

pip3 install Nuitka

## HOW TO USE

if you know how to crosscompile a python file into an exe on linux based os then go right ahead but if you dont put the payload in a virtual machine that has windows installed

make sure that you have python installed pip install the requirement then do the following

C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts\nuitka.bat --windows-disable-console --windows-icon-from-ico=icon.ico --windows-product-version=1.1 --windows-company-name=WHATEVER --onefile tcpclient.py

if you want to be able to add an icon make sure that what ever icon you want to use is converted into an ICO then specity the location of it in the "-windows-icon-from-ico=icon.ico" arg.
